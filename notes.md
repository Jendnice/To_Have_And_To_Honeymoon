  NOTES:

  - When everything is set, update the config > intializers > cors.rb to have specific frontend url instead of all ('*') in origins. Instead, and based on your frontend repo address, it should say something like:
        origins 'localhost:8000'  
        or 
        origins 'localhost:/3000'
  - Do NOT include a backslash at the end of the address!
  Also update the resource '*', headers, and methods, to only reflect what you're using in your project.
