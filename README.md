_To Have and to Honeymoon_ provides an elegant and seamless way for future honeymooners to compare travel locations. By allowing users to add locations, and experiences within those locations in a clean and engaging design, users can highlight the areas they're most interested in enjoying for their once-in-a-lifetime trip. 

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rake db:migrate
```

Then run the backend (Rails API) in a local server:

```
$ rails server

```
Finally, navigate to the _frontend_ folder and open the _index.html_ file in the browser of your choice.

Have fun and happy honeymooning!
